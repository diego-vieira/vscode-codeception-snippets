# Codeception Snippets

Snippets to help you writing [Codeception](http://codeception.com) tests in [Atom.io](http://atom.io).

## TODO

* REST
* SOAP

## Patches & Features

* Fork
* Mod, fix
* Test - this is important, so it's not unintentionally broken
* Commit - do not mess with license, todo, version, etc. (if you do change any, bump them into commits of their own that I can ignore when I pull)
* Pull request - bonus point for topic branches
